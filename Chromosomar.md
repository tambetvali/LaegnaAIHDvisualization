***This is the next part, but I just committed before going to 20-min coffee and cigaretter so you do not have to wait haha.***

In [Laegna AI High-Dimensional Visualization](https://github.com/tambetvali/LaegnaAIHDvisualization), we compared:
- AI cells with their nearest connections with atoms;
  - Connections occuring in time turn layers and attention layers into molecular structure
  - Connections occuring in space, simulataneous parallel moments turn the vector-to-vector connections through matrices into molecular bonds of
    cells of the vector.

In (DL and ML as Ms. and Mr. AI)[https://github.com/tambetvali/LaegnaAIHDvisualization] we compared automata to male, and optimization to female principle - DL becomes mainly female, whereas ML unites with
classical programming and proving with their syntax, and becomes male. We also mentioned that neither carries only one principle - rather it's a work on archetypes than trying to classify males and females;
indeed a strong female might beat weak male in the most masculine traits, and we have different aspects of police work. Still, we can see females rather talking in patterns and avoiding heavy logic, while
males rather try to understand practical logic and avoid buzzling around in resemblances and long-term complexes and relations.

We go further and we need to show this kind of thing:
- Atoms are bond in space, and their bonds in time react synchronously in our Atomic imagination.
- We can project ML, Perceptron and GPT, but
  - GPT is *always* like this simple perceptron, but the perceptron is having *flow*:
    - This atomic moment is single moment and any moment is such;
      - In ML or simple Perceptron, such moments resolve the whole theme.
    - In GPT, it processes text moment by moment, moving further, where it's either learning or writing;
      - The moment-to-moment passage of time is "exterior" to this perceptron, but while it's moving and mutating,
      - the way it flows through passatge of time becomes part of it's model or behaviour or architecture,
        - Thus let's relate this to passing light, RNA strands or anything other in our model.
        - I think we make our model more similar to RNA; but it's a funny structure, where readers spray the text into air into small pieces of RNA, which do not encode
          the whole text (for one atom); in other view the RNA becomes electrons and is rotating around atoms in timely fashion;

To make it clear association: let's call them RNA electrons, electron structure is how they rotate around atoms one after another, meeting our model;
- It would more proper if molecules of RNA float around and their "character" atoms, such as adenine, uracil, guanine, cytosine are reacting with our atoms;
- but rather I do not try to explain anything complicated about RNA, or even understand in this context - we want to see AI in action and it's enough
  if we call the chain order of our sequence "RNA", and think even these electrons form kind of molecules - something, what actually does not happen
  with electrons every day; more naturally, they pass our molecule in order, where the electron moves step by step, from last atom to the first or
  vice versa - this is a *metaphor*, so it's not symbolizing anything particular in Atom, but when we use the *models* by which we understand Atoms
  in our mind, being physics-reflective beings; this kind of virtual physics simply is: visual and understandable. Not electrons, there is not much
  intuitive about them, but rather the little balls which bond with something one after another, seem so natural as if we were creating pearl jewerly
  from them when we were little amoebas :)

We do one more correlation:
- X chromosomes (female) for fuzzy activities in optimizer
- Y chromosomes (male) for rational activities in code

We see female process is exponential, parallel; male processes are linear and lonely workers on long threads:
