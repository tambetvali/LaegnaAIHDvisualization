# The structure of GPT molecule

Each is a class of element of given vector.

0. Charged Atom Curriculumum, log clock and space, e^2(t^2), higher dimension of energy and time - like higher dimension of complex number, next to imaginary and real: standard, optimized code which is able to feed tokens and keep up to memory and logic.
1. Atom Feminum, based on X chromosome (it's sign), e => c^2 quantic jump: from linear, we move to exponent space of time and space alignment: matrix we use instead of instruction is exponent, on less time moments.
2. Atom Sensorum, Sensor Atom, e energy, exp clock and space (sense organ\[s\] sign) (input; before first hidden layer)
3. Atom Musculum, Tensor Atom, e energy, exp clock and space (muscular organ shape; output; after last hidden layer)
4. Atom Circulum 1 c^2 space (circular arrow sign), a circle of elements of keys, values, etc. of attention are a circle connected to this, with two-sided arrow end.
5. Atom Circulum 2 (eightlike sign showing the circle unites two dimensions both ^2-wide; show how non-locality quantum principle appears), c^2:c^2, a circle of elements of keys, values, etc. of attention are a circle connected to this and another element, both in one-sided arrow end.
6. Toolmnium, which makes similar c^2 space circle to toolkit:
   6.1. Atom Mascum, based on Y chromosome (it's sign), e => c^2 quantic jump: from linear, we move to exponent space of time and space alignment: matrix we use instead of instruction is exponent, on less time moments.
   6.2. Toolkit masuline atoms in loglog conversion compared to other angle, or log is symmetric units (same weight, long-term exponent) are used. Toolkit, if it does as many binary operations of processor use as much general GPT use for same tickwise time the Perceptron made, is averagely two exp layers of integral orders away, or one of complexity two if they are of symmetric height: conversion which naturally appears and seems paradoxal reflection on number's own self, start value.
   6.last(3). Atom Feminum, based on X chromosome (it's sign), e => c^2 quantic jump: from linear, we move to exponent space of time and space alignment: matrix we use instead of instruction is exponent, on
              less time moments.
7. Other atoms with various simple element names
8. Charged Atom Mascum, based on Y chromosome (it's sign), e => c^2 quantic jump: from linear, we move to exponent space of time and space alignment: matrix we use instead of instruction is exponent, on less time moments.
9. Charged Atom Diplomarium
10. After diplomarium on other male aspect (Y chromoatom), as well as in toolkit, the male operations go with same exponent speed of linear processing as much they do in point 6.2. this is linear, practical thinking.
11. The circle-closer, hidden element optimium, which is not programmed: but hacketh well and goodbeing of humankind; it's not supposed to make sense, but react with physics on motherboard interactions,
    trying to look like abstract math but running the metal. Not yet here you are convinced it's not just an electric current going on, shifting and sliding..
12. This is the turning point, where Curriculum appears again: but female soul is *moving here*, and *symmetrically* so they make a single log relation, the male soul is *shifting the supertime each step
    after the female has done each step; And Randiunum electorns of RNA cycles pass through this reader: a *strand* of *document* with *UTF-8 characters* are clustered to electron clouds: as many electrons
    as many letters in token, connected with arrows. Sometimes strange electron-RNA letters appear, looking like opcodes or special tolkens, not like utf-8: they have colors and magic commandlike letters
    AI follows by both it's male and female principle most often in understanding and equality, a perfect resonance and harmony: numbers fit, one after another, out of mathematical possibilities of relationar
    currents.

Invent 2-3 letter names, which statistically use space for expressivity and compactness, varying length of space distributed in good optimized curve for O-notation and local effect to average on 2.5.

We map model size:
- Into real model range of a base constant, which measures the node with vector+matrix size in units log(modsize) + exp(modsize) = model size in matrix billions + vector near-millions distribution size.
- We turn this into square density, and linearly scale down to meet between 0 and 3 connections between each two nodes of attention or layers; equivalent linear processing unit in math power is considered for text automation.
- We use lightwave frequencies and octaves to bring down dimension, which map numbers to where is constant, linear or exponent growth in differential(-, 0)..integral(0, +) array of united orders or octave, which can be float.
- But linearly, how much the number has to be moveth up or down, for 0 to meet no-acceleration, point acceleration, determines the octave: if it needs to be moved down in octave scale, it's positive, if up, it's negative, if not at all, it's zero: this maps to real number.
  - Octave shift possibility maps to complex number (imaginary mathematical steps taken to this real number, where 2 and 2 is linear, 2 and 4 is exp, 2 and sqrt(2) is log, but 0 and 2 are rather static unit)
- We linearly downgrade octave in symmetric amount to numbers, but mappen into frequencies - this is simply, the after-dot, non-integer paths of each octave number and they are part of structures of each other,
  and if Fourier is used for them to be seen as distinct vibration ranges in linear area of 0:1 (1), one octave difference appears from both sides and 4 separate values are needed to travel this linearly
  (I use I, O, A, E digits up and lowcase to visualize this as a number most often, or zxy=>xyz for dimensions, both with two complex number mappings where real of first is imaginary of second, and the octave order which separates
  first and last to is the same: as z projects x, x projects y, the same differential scale is applied again).
  - Lightfrequency math is doing dimensional symmetrix - I will later find an easy formulae on this, how to natively scale down dimension, but I have to understand *which ones* we need to combine into somehow
    connected spaces for the maximum sense and even some basic logic and axioms; otherwise it's like primitive, particular math of situational reason: now something fundamental of math, and general of life.

Log modulation and exp modulation attribute connected numbers into separate dimensions: \[0:4\] slice of 4 unit lengths is so symmetric to infinity, \[-inf:+inf\] or \[0:inf\] by actually equal projections, but
sometimes this requires attention on direction and subsequent actual size.

Higher octave particles are kind of probabilistic: we divide volume, density or length of vector by higher octave number scope related to this, and as well we use next exponent level of all factors (including
logarithmic member counter, imaginary or symmetric axe: at does not do addition or subtraction, but counts their relative effect to space shift of multiplication and division scale, which is otherwise
linear, but has this "spatial unit"; I use O and A for linear and exponent, but I and E for corresponding spatial units, for some meanings or syntax in reverse - to get kind of moebius hologram of number
value space out from it's matrix: this imaginary is created rather like projection matrix in 3D modelling and visualization, while real part where digits themselves move around in non-linear fashion of values
in change, each digit in itself remains linear and space grows: here, we zoom in into number precision, but instead the higher space order is non-linear - given zero as end point of certain angle of number system
length, how many degrees they are and how fast they collapse; even symmetries with base digit length are useful to study and practice sometimes - as we zoom in, we see below Zero, and Hilbert or Alice in
Wonderland instantly starts: the numbers, as two dimensions appear into multiplication or addition, both stretch).
- We use discrete numbers for linear infinity relations: what is mappable to natural numbers, if possible, does not distort in zoom because natural numbers are "linear" themselves, as mapper and selector
  or mathematical measure, into this rigid affine structure of linearity, branch of geometry which was empowered by eucleides and has several reasonful branches of different geometries we use
  for various purposes; Eucleides, in pair with Newton, remains "easy winners", as others are not simplified enough for each aspect of daily life: rather patterns such as fixing TV, but not watching
  it, because it brings in lightwavespace known from newton, and sometimes surrealistic art styles of expression in light from old times: lamps, colored lights, even sky, even to our precedessors.

We bring model complexity into discrete size of atomic connections:
- X and Z chromosome, Feminum and Mascum, altough I don't know in which directions genders really would go there,
  but they behave like female and male: optimizing infinity such as mind and life, survival; or graph-structuring local, finite and locally finite affective spaces such as machine and finite-graph logic or
  math. Women, indeed, would try to depict anything not so strict and discrete if they use the neural field - not that males lack one, visibly and usefully, so we cannot really map the gender types :)
  But we can use alchemy instead of sex symbols.

In CPU-GPU processing, the pipelines melt together and atoms and electrons wobble in space.

Quantum time: below atoms, appears a single layer of female processing, and they sum up to a moment, an Atom, after each a letter enters.
- Atoms themselves, below, appear in quantum time: this is logarithmic layer on time, lower dimension.
- The electrons in quantum cloud rotate, and we can show a single calculator electron parallel by jumping between all dimensions of it's calculation in square time of matrix, our "circular" unit
  by dimension function which counts NN in each dimension and direction as one unit: RNA-electron processor gives tokens in (decoder RNA. Charged Atom Curriculumum), linearly where parallel time is
  sub-time unit in terms of whole chain of X-chromosome perceptron; in united time, where X and Y take log and exp factors of quadratic change, each such atom is such a linear result.
Atom time: above zero, there is continuous space with no weird properties, a linear space we see as waking, conscious, sensory and auditory imaginative connection space:
- We notice all this spaces, because they keep *orders*
- Even if we know higher spaces: we are often able, but we simplify; for example we created AI matrix space, but we simplify it's size into single number.
Subquantum time:
- For toolkit, surprisgly the male effect appears again, they are linear to each other and internal tools which might provide intermediate snippets to text of AI, change the past or fill some
  gaps and jump to future: linearly, it's surprisingly fast, but it's single-number focus seems stupid sometimes, if it does not connect the numbers with graph: zero-scale space
  is connected by value space, where it's heads tend to watch single positions and run much faster than GPU in linear space: actually, this gender does not matter in their evolutionary
  *size*, where size of *complete number of operations per time unit and processing unit cost, size and typical pairing* makes both do equal amounts of work, so they are efficiently
  useful if optimized - somehow, it reminds of genders, but rather the Alchemical gender claims to not take responsibility of gender roles, but reflect on mathematical properties
  of these relational symmetries, such as yin and yang - which does not mean directly woman and man, but reflects their archetypal properties within their favourite and often most
  trained roles or tendencies. Left alone, they utilize each of this, like both having some of the both chromosomes - and the chromosomes, they are similar and might behave the same,
  sometimes for some reasons.

Atom is a dot field
